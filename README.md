# GenoInsight: AI-Powered Variant Intelligence for Precision Medicine

**Problem:** Healthcare teams struggle with fragmented patient data (clinical records, genomic data, lab results) while bioinformatics analyses remain inaccessible to clinicians. Large-scale sequencing generates thousands of variants, but identifying clinically relevant ones is difficult. Additionally, communicating these technical insights to non-scientists delays clinical decisions and reduces impact.

**Our Solution:** GenoInsight is an integrated platform that bridges the gap between genomic variant discovery and clinical action through three interconnected modules: AI Variant Hunter, Clinical Translation Engine, Patient Communication Dashboard.

**Impact:** We hope to reduces variant interpretation time from days to minutes, minimizes miscommunication between genomics labs and clinicians, empowers patients with understandable genomic insights, and ensures regulatory compliance for clinical deployment.
